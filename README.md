# CS445 Project: Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the project for the CS445 - Natural Language Processing course. 

## Overview
Our project explores intent recognition and slot filling, key tasks in natural language understanding. We conducted two experiments, as outlined below:

### Experiments
1. **Baseline Model**: Our baseline with logistic regression and TF-IDF achieved an accuracy of **93%**.
2. **Bi-model with Slot-filling**: Authors of this method received an accuracy of **98%**.

We aim to further improve these results and compare with state-of-the-art approaches.
